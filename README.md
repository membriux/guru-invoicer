# Guru Invoicer
Simple tool for generating my weekly invoices to CodePath. Instead of manually inputting the date and other info about the invoice, it automates all of that so all I have to worry about is putting the hours, preventing errors in small details like dates or typos. It can generate previous invoices as well by scrolling through the cycles.
